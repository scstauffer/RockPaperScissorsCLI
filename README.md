# RockPaperScissorsCLI

Play against the computer in a game of rock paper scissors and keep track of your score!  

This was a side project to familiarize myself better with OOP, Math.Random, and FileIO. 

This project was completed while attending the Tech Elevator boot camp. You can learn more about Tech Elevator's coding bootcamps here: https://www.techelevator.com/.
